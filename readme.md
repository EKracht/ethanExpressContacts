This is my CRUD app contact list.

This will allow you to add to the contact list, remove contact rows, and edit contact rows.

The info will be saved in the server until you delete it.

First, cd into the project directory, and do npm run setup to install the dependencies listed in the package.json and bower.json. Then you can start the server in Node.
